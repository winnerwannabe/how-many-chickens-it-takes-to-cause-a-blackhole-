  <P style="color:rgb(50,200,50)">to find how many chickens it would take to make a black hole, we need to know two things. the mass of the smallest possible black hole and the mass of the avrage chicken.(keep in mind i just did a google search and used the first thing i saw so if someone was lieing i could be really off.) so according to <a href="scientificamerican.com/gallery/the-smallest-known-black-hole/#:~:text=Link%20copied!-,NASA%20scientists%20have%20identified%20the%20lightest%20black%20hole%20yet%2C%20just,in%20at%206.3%20solar%20masses.">scientificamerican.com,</a> the mass of a black hole is "just 3.8 times the mass of the sun" and i am not going to spend more time looking for an exact number. so that means we just need to multiply the mass of the sun(according to google it is 1.989 Ã— 10^30 kg) by 3.8. and that comes out to 7.5582e+30. now for the second number we need. according to <a href="https://beyondthetreat.com/chicken-weight/#:~:text=%E2%80%8BTaking%20into%20account%20all,(3.4%20kg)%20for%20roosters.">beyondthetreat.com,</a> the average weight of a chicken is "5.5 pounds (2.5 kg) for hens and 7.5 pounds (3.4 kg) for roosters." we don't want to use just one or the other so we will find the average between the two, which turns out to be 2.95. so to find out the amount of chickens it takes to create a black hole we need to divide 7.5582e+30 by 2.95, which is 2.5621017e+30. so the awnser to the most commonly asked question is... 2.5621017e+30!!! because clearly the most commonly asked question is "how many chickens does it take to create a black hole?"</P>
